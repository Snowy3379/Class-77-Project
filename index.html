    <h1> Project on Console</h1>
    <p>Visual studio is a great way to code and make webpages.</p>
    <p>The console screen is very helpful because it can be used to check your mistakes and it is very cool. You can open it by
        right clicking the page and pressing inspect. Then press "Console" and you will see the console section there.

        console.log ("My first at home Console Project!")

        var firstName = "Kushi"
        var lastName = "Milan"
        var fullName = firstName.concat(lastName)
        console.log (fullName)
